house_of_leaves
===============

This is a browser extension for Chrome, however the javascript is most likely reusable as a greasemonkey script.

I've implented coloring of the words "house" and "minotaur." Strikethroughs are also colored red, but in the book, only the text is red while the strikethough line is black. Implementing this is far more complicated than I have time for at the moment. It would probably involve floating a div over the word in question. Have fun.

Installation
============
Navigate to the extensions page in the Chrome settings. Check 'developer mode', click 'Load unpacked extension...' and select the directory containing these files.
