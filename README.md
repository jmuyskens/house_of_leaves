house_of_leaves
===============

This is a browser extension for Chrome, however the javascript is reusable as a greasemonkey script.

I've implented coloring of the words "house" and "minotaur." <del>Strikethroughs are also colored lime green</del>, but in the book, they were red with seemingly no regard for colorblind usability.  Have fun.

Installation
============
Navigate to the extensions page in the Chrome settings. Check 'developer mode', click 'Load unpacked extension...' and select the directory containing these files. You can reload this page to test the extension.
